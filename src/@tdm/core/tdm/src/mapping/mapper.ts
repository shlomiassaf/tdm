 * Represents the contract a Deserializer needs to implements.
 * A Deserializer should handle both a collection and a single item and should be able to identify them.
 *
 * Since deserialization transforms UNKNOWN document to a KNOWN document the deserializer must implement
 * a specific interface so the library can normalize an unknown document into a known one.
 *
 * If a collection is found the deserializer move to an iteration mode via the next() method.
 * In a collection, the cursor must not point on an item until the first call to next().
 * In a single item next() is never used so the cursor must point to the item provided.
 *
 * The deserialization process:
 *   - Initialize the item (constructor) and identify the type (collection/single)
 *   - Find and return the keys for the current item (getKeys() done for each item)
 *   - Get the value for a given key
 *
 *
 * The Deserializer is responsible for deserializing the whole document, including nested items and
 * related items. It is therefor recommended to keep a cache of generated items if the document is expected to have nested resources.
 * Caching logic can be implemented by implementing the `setRef()` and `getIdentity()` methods and
 * using a child deserializer class or a count flag.
 *
 * > See `directMapper` and `@tdm/json-api-mapper` for implementation example.
