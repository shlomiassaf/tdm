   * ###EXAMPLE
   * ```ts
   * {
   *  transformNameStrategy: {
   *    incoming: (propertyName: string) => camelCase(propertyName),
   *    outgoing: (propertyName: string) => snakeCase(propertyName)
   *  }

   * ```ts

   * The example above converts incoming server object properties to camel case (myProperty)
   * and all outgoing client object properties to snake case (my_property)
   *
   * > In exclusive mode (transformStrategy = 'exclusive` or decorating a class with @Exclude) there
   * is no meaning to the `incoming` strategy since incoming keys are not part of the process, only
   * properties defined with @Prop. This means that the outgoing strategy is a mapper for both incoming and outgoing.
   *

   * @default undefined
