   *
   * The `FormArray` instance contains `FromGroup` instances while the render instruction matching the `FormArray`
   * instance contains the elements we need to render, i.e. the primitives flattened controls.
   *
   * We need to resolve the `FormControl` matching each child using the `FormGroup` item, this path enables that
   * because it is relative to the first item in the array, which is our `FormGroup`
   *
   * Example:
   * ```ts
   * @Prop({
   *   form: {
   *     flatten: {
   *       y: {
   *         flatten: {
   *           z: {

   * })
   * x: Array<{
   *   y: {
   *     z: number;
   *   }
   * }>;
   * ```
   *
   * The property above describes an array of an object defined using a flattening expression.
   * The object has an inner object `y` and `y` has a property `z`.
   *
   * The flattening expression extract's `z`.
   *
   * The renderer will get a `FormArray` instance with each child being a `FormGroup` with item `x`.
   * the render instructions will represent and array with each child representing `z`.
   *
   * We need to resolve the control bound to the UI element, the control that matches `z` but we have `FormGroup` `x`
   * which contains that control.
   *
   * This path will resolve that and it's value will be `y.z`. We have `x` so we get `y` then from `y` we get `z`.
   *
   * This will work with any level
