To bind a model and an adapter together\\na decorator is used, <code>@HttpResource()</code> which replaces <code>@Model()</code>.</p>\\n<p>Let&#39;s recap:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Model</strong>: A class representing a structure</li>\\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: An HTTP operation that the model supports (a.k.a operation)</li>\\n<li><strong>Adapter</strong>: A logical unit that executes an <strong>Action</strong> on a <strong>Model</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Resource</strong>: A <strong>Model</strong> bound to an <strong>Adapter</strong> with mapped <strong>Actions</strong>. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We will not use the term <strong>Model</strong> from here on but note that when we\\nrefer to a <strong>Resource</strong> it is also a <strong>Model</strong>.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"alert\\\">\\nBecause a <strong>Resource</strong> is an extension of a <strong>Model</strong> we can use a\\nthe same class decorated as a <strong>Resource</strong> to describe dynamic form\\ndefinitions. \\n</div>\\n\\n<h2><a id=\\\"resource-control\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#resource-control\\\"><span class=\\\"header-link\\\"></span></a>Resource Control</h2><p>Resources, Actions and Adapters are used by <code>@tdm/data</code> as an API to\\ndescribe actions for a resource and how to execute them.</p>\\n<p>In addition, <code>@tdm/data</code> comes with an API to control (running) actions,\\nlisten to resource events and work with resources.</p>\\n<p>For example, cancelling a running actions, replay a previous action,\\nclone a resource, etc...</p>\\n\"}]\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/demo/modules/@http/tutorial/1a-overview/__tdm-code__.ts\n// module id = ZAK8\n// module chunks = 16"],"sourceRoot":"webpack:///"}
